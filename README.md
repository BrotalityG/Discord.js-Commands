# Discord.js-Commands
This repository gives you a series of commands you can add to your bot at your will, including some useful ones that may replace the need for a support server or dealing with loads of DM's.

# Want a command added?
Join my disord <a href="rfclan.net" hreflang="en-us">server</a> and suggest it there, with the bot command -suggest (suggestion)!

Expect more updates to this in the coming months.
